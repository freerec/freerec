In rough priority order:

• Display a VU meter for input.

• Let the user type a title for the current/next recording. Store it in file
  tags and names.

• Display adjacent songs from top to bottom instead of from left to right,
  similar to the compact view in Nautilus. Any scrolling would be horizontal.

• Automatic mixer control based on measured input volume?
