In rough priority order:

• Display songs in columns, similar to the compact view in Nautilus. Should
  prevent the need to scroll.

• Display a VU meter for input.

• Let the user type a title for the current/next recording. Store it in file
  tags and names.

• Localization with gettext.

• Automatic mixer control based on measured input volume?
