FreeRec provides a simple interface to record audio in MP3 and Speex formats
and to play songs from a static list.

The latest version is available at <http://github.com/freerec/freerec>. The
repository contains Ubuntu packaging in the debian branch.

Runtime dependencies:

• Ruby 1.8
• The gst and gtk2 bindings for Ruby 1.8 from ruby-gnome2

• The following GStreamer plugins:
  • (base) audioconvert
  • (base) audioresample
  • (base) decodebin
  • (base) ogg
  • (good) autodetect
  • (good) speex
  • (ugly) lame
  • (ugly) mad

• You also need to be using a Gtk icon theme that provides the audio-x-generic
  icon. If you’re not a Gnome user, installing e.g. gnome-icon-theme and using
  the following .gtkrc-2.0 suffices:

    gtk-icon-theme-name = "gnome"

  Other alternatives include oxygen (for KDE users) and Tango.
